# NASA NEAR EARTH OBJECTS

Dataset -- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sameepvani/nasa-nearest-earth-objects

# Predciting the probability whether a space object will collide with Earth or not given the following features

   1. Minimum Estimated Diameter in Kilometres
   2. Maximum Estimated Diameter in Kilometres
   3. Velocity Relative to Earth
   4. Distance in Kilometres missed
   5. Describes intrinsic luminosity

## We have used a Random Forest Classifier to predict. The test metrics are as follows -
   1>Accuracy =  0.9202994275649493,
   2>F1-Score = 0.4972222222222222,
   3>Precision = 0.6580882352941176,
   4>ROC-AUC-Score = 0.6884187007118431,
   5>Recall = 0.39955357142857145}
